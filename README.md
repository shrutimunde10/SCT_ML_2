# SCT_ML_2
# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository provides a Python implementation of K-Means clustering for segmenting retail store customers based on their purchase behavior. The algorithm groups customers into clusters using features such as Annual Income and Spending Score, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Analysis**: Dynamically determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- **Visualization**: Generates 2D scatter plots of clusters and centroids for intuitive understanding of customer segments.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle datasets with multiple numerical features efficiently.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this implementation is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following attributes:

- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned based on spending behavior and purchasing patterns.

### Steps to Use:
1. Specify the features to use for clustering (e.g., Annual Income and Spending Score).
2. Define the number of clusters manually or use the Elbow Method for guidance.
3. View the generated visualizations and clustered data.

## Results

The script produces the following outputs:

1. **Clustered Data**:
   - The dataset with an additional column indicating the cluster each customer belongs to.

2. **Cluster Visualization**:
   - A scatter plot illustrating customer clusters and their centroids (for 2D features).

3. **Exported Data**:
   - Clustered data is saved as a CSV file (`Clustered_Customers.csv`) in the project directory.

## Acknowledgments

- The dataset is publicly available and used for educational purposes.
- Built using the `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries.
